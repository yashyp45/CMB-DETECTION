# Cerebral Microbleed Detection Using Deep Learning
This repository contains the code for a Deep Learning project focused on detecting cerebral microbleeds in medical images. 
The project utilizes various deep learning architectures, including U-Net, U-Net Plus, and Attention U-Net, to achieve accurate segmentation results.

## Overview
Objective: Develop deep learning models for precise cerebral microbleed detection.
Technologies: Python, TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, albumentations, keras-unet-collection.
Datasets: The project uses MRI scan images for training and testing.

## Features
- Implemented U-Net, U-Net Plus, and Attention U-Net architectures for semantic segmentation.
- Preprocessing techniques such as resizing, normalization, and data augmentation were applied to enhance model performance.
- Evaluated model performance using metrics like accuracy, Dice coefficient, and IoU.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   
   ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/your-username/CMB-detection.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the notebooks or scripts to train and evaluate the deep learning models.

## Results
Achieved improved segmentation accuracy and clinical relevance with the developed deep learning models.
Model performance metrics (accuracy, Dice coefficient, IoU) are visualized and discussed in the project notebooks.
